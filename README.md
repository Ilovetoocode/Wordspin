# Wordspin

A simple set of python scripts that can take any sort of article, and change up the wording! Created for Comp1020 as an assignment, this program is perfect for if you need to rephrase anything!
(Note: It's not actually all that good at that task, please don't use this in your actual writing! ESPECIALLY if you plan to plagerize. You will get caught!)


# How to use


1: Make sure your computer has Python 3.10.12 or later installed/part of an IDE on it. If you have an older version, make sure to update it. No python? [Go here and install it.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2: Get the code from this page by either downloading it as a zip archive or by cloning it in a git cleint of your choice.

3: Open up the folder in a terminal or a python IDE of your choosing.

4: Within the project folder, open the essay.txt file and overwrite the example text within the document with whatever you want to spin.

5: Start the python interperter and run wordspin.py/Click the run button of the project window of Wordspin.py.

6: For any results you like, copy the results.txt file somewhere else, it erases itself each time you run the program.

# Limitations
This program:
1: Will output all results as lowercase. Proper capitalization needs to be added into outputs by users.

2:Does not know or care about context of words. Anything that comes out of this program has a high likelyhood of not making sense.

3: Will not output your scentances with any form of punctuation. Everything will be one giant run on scentance.

4:Will never have the above fixed, due to being too far outside of the assignment scope... And also to discourage any plagerists from using this program.
