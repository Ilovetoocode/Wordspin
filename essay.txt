Indifference curves show the various combinations of real income and leisure time that will yield some specific level of utility or satisfaction to the individual. For our purposes, we measure daily income on the vertical axis and hours of leisure, or non-labor market activities, from left to right on the horizontal axis. The second horizontal axis reminds us that, given the fixed 24 hours available each day, we may measure the number of hours of work from right to left.
